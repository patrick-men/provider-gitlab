# provider-gitlab

## Overview

`provider-gitlab` is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/). The provider that is built from the source code
in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the
following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Gitlab resources
* Controllers to provision these resources in Gitlab based on the users desired
  state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource
  abstractions, enabling
  Gitlab resources to fulfill a user's general need for Gitlab configurations

## Getting Started and Documentation

Create a [Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) on your GitLab instance with the scope set to `api` and fill in the corresponding Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gitlab-credentials -n crossplane-system --from-literal=token="<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Configure a `ProviderConfig` with a baseURL pointing to your GitLab instance:
```yaml
apiVersion: gitlab.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: gitlab-provider
spec:
  baseURL: https://gitlab.com/
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    method: PersonalAccessToken
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: gitlab-credentials
      key: token
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/providerconfig/provider.yaml
```
